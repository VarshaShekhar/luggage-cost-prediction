# 🎒 Luggage Bag Cost Prediction — Linear Regression Project

A mini machine learning project built during my AI/ML postgraduate program at BITS Pilani. It predicts the cost of luggage bags based on real product data using various gradient descent techniques.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Predict luggage bag **cost** using physical attributes: `Height`, `Width`, `Length`, `Weight`, and `Weight1`.  
Built using 160 samples of real-world data.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- ✅ Batch Gradient Descent (Manual)
- ✅ Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (Manual)
- ✅ Stochastic Gradient Descent (Manual)
- ✅ Scikit-learn Linear Regression (Baseline)

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Mean imputation for missing values  
- Outlier handling with **relaxed IQR**  
- Standardized scaling for feature normalization  
- Converted to numeric using `pandas.to_numeric()`
